## SUMMARY
Lymphocytes are key to immune surveillance of tumors, but our understanding of the spatial organization and physical interactions that facilitate lymphocyte anti-cancer functions is limited. Here, we used multiplexed imaging, quantitative spatial analysis, and machine learning to create high-definition maps of tumor-bearing lung tissues from a Kras/p53 mouse model and human resections. Networks of interacting lymphocytes (‘lymphonets’) emerged as a distinctive feature of the anti-cancer immune response. Lymphonets nucleated from small T-cell clusters and incorporated B cells with increasing size. CXCR3-mediated trafficking modulated lymphonet size and number, but T-cell antigen expression directed intratumoral localization. Lymphonets preferentially harbored TCF1+PD1+ progenitor CD8 T cells involved in responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Upon treatment of mice with ICB or an antigen-targeted vaccine, lymphonets retained progenitor and gained cytotoxic CD8 T-cell populations, likely via progenitor differentiation. These data show that lymphonets create a spatial environment supportive of CD8 T-cell anti-tumor responses.

Some data is available as narrated data explorations (with text and audio narration) for anonymous on-line browsing using MINERVA software (Rashid et al., 2022), which allows users to pan and zoom through the images without requiring any software installation.

## Codes for imaging data processing

Highplex Orion whole-slide images were processed using [MCMICRO](https://mcmicro.org/) modules with customizations to cope with the large X-Y dimension in the dataset. Registration of immunofluorescence images and H&E images was done with [PALOM](https://github.com/yu-anchen/palom).
